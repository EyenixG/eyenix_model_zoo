Welcome to the **EYENIX Model Zoo**, a collection of high-performance deep learning models optimized for deployment on our **NPU-integrated product lineup**.

The model zoo includes both **public models**, which are pre-trained on widely used open datasets, and **release models**, which are trained in-house on Eyenix’s proprietary datasets for real-world. Using this model zoo, you can evaluate the accuracy of each model directly on Eyenix SoCs and compare performance across tasks.   
It also provides pre-compiled binary files, allowing you to run inference on the NPU immediately without additional conversion steps.
> ⚠️ **Access Notice**  
> This Model Zoo is intended **solely for EYENIX customers under a valid contractual agreement**.  
> Please note that access and usage are limited to authorized partner companies.
